# Embedded GUI Project

## MVC paradigm

Model is the data. Control is the logic. View is the graphics

Everyone should have the backend, the M and C parts. You already have a model,
the cell.

## SDLC

Cascade. Start with analysis, cascade into design, then to implementation, then
to testing. Testing can lead back to implementation. In poorly planned
projects, testing can lead back to design or even analysis.

Alpha -> Beta -> Release

Analysis spec due next week. Trying to create the project definition, and the
scope. "What is it going to do?" Describe it in plain english. Create class
diagrams. Implementation in C++. Testing

UML a design implementation specification language. We will use some UML in the
design phase to make class diagrams.

## Hints

Given an array

    BArray = | 4 | 3 | 2 | 7 | 2 | 1 | 100 | 9 | 0 |

Create an array that has 8 individual arrays with the sizes specified in BArray

Count to the end of BArray, indicated by 0.

     1 int main() {
     2     int *BArray = new int[6];
     3     BArray[0] = 2;
     4     BArray[1] = 5;
     5     BArray[2] = 18;
     6     BArray[3] = 7;
     7     BArray[4] = 1;
     8     BArray[5] = 0;
     9
    10     int i, len;
    11     int *ptr = BArray;
    12     int **NewArray;
    13
    14     len = 0;
    15     while (*ptr != 0) {
    16         len++;
    17         ptr++;
    18     }
    19
    20     NewArray = new int *[len];
    21     for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    22         NewArray[i] = new int[BArray[i]];
    23     }
    24 }
