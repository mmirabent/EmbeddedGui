# Assignment hint


Should be using wxPoint for the drawing assignment

# Midterm Hints

Problem 1

* pointers, references and typedefs
* pointers to int arrays
* pointers to functions
* know how to pass an array of function pointers to a function

Problem 2

* Dynamic memory allocation
* generate array will return a pointer to the array
* print array will take a pointer from generate array
* remove array properly deletes the array

Problem 3

* If you do not complete assignment 4, you will not be able to solve this problem

Problem 4

* understand event handling

Problem 5

* inheritance and polymirphism
    * Classes
    * Abstraction

Problem 6

* wxDocumentation, you may have to go up the inheritance chain to find the information you need

Problem 7

* what does this line do?

# Chapter 5

Painting on draw. Before you can paint, you need a "device context." The device
context is like a canvas that you can draw on. You have to attach tools to the
canvas in order to draw. 

Double buffering means if you get a device context for the window and you start
to draw something complex, the user will see the individual drawing actions.
When you are done, you do a "bit belt" to copy the buffer onto the DC.

For drawing on a paint event, use PaintDC or BufferedPaintDC. For the assignemnt, we need the DC for the draw panel

On the click event, if you're in click mode, add the positoin of the click to the vector of wxPoints
