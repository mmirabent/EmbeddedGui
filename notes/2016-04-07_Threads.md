# Process vs Thread

Process is an operating system concept

Kernel controls a PCB (Process Control Block)

Each process has it's own memory space

The kernel uses time slicing to schedule processes to run. Each process gets a "Quantum time" which is a fancy name for a slice of time.

There are multiple queues in the kernel. The running queue holds the processes that are running(duh). The Ready queue is processes that are ready to run. The blocked queue(or list) is processes that are waiting on something else, i.e. "blocked."

A thread runs within the context of a process. At any time, you can spawn a thread. If a thread crashes, it can crash the whole process. But that crashed process won't also crash the rest of the system because of protected memory.

Scheduling of threads is also done with timeslicing.
